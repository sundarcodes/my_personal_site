Just wanted to share and list down the tools that I use for my projects (web-development in particular).

### VS Code

I have become a super fan of VS-Code, so so light weight and it has become the defacto Editor for any JS projects - frontend as well as backend. I use it for few of my python projects as well it works as a Charm (infact better than PyCharm.. :)

You have got to master the keyboard shortcut keys to make full leverage of any editor. Here is the link to VSCode keyboard cheat sheet for [Mac][vs-code-mac-cheat-sheet] and [Windows][vs-code-windows-cheat-sheet]

### Docker

Absolutely love docker just for the simplicity it offers to setting up an complex environments all in my local box. I could not put everything here.. so working on a dedicated post for it.. Docker rocks !!

### transfer.sh

This is my go to file sharing space. I could quickly upload files from command line or simply drag and drop. I just get a shareable link and that's it.. Ofcourse it supports encrpytion of our files in case you would need it. Try [it][transfer.sh] out if you haven't. Thanks to the [dutchcoders][dutch-coders] for this !!

### gitlab - Issue Tracking/ CI / CD

I have been using gitlab for most of my private projects and am very happy with it. It is my one stop store for Planning features/stories, bug tracking and the CI/CD capababilities it provides.

### iterm

I love working on the command line, but it slowly pulls me down when I have too many command lines open and I constantly have to switch amongst them. I found an instant liking with [iterm][iterm] as I was able to manage my command lines better, all in one single screen.

### TypeScript

Nowadays, if I am working on a NodeJS or on building a web app, TypeScript is what I setup first. TypeScript has become an indespensable part of web development these days with official starter kits of Angular(by default), VueJS and React (coming up, though we have create-react-app starter for TypeScript)


### [Mock Data generator][mockaroo]

I found a great tool to generate mock data for my projects. I use it for testing purposes and it is very useful. Its [mockaroo][mockaroo]
