This is my collection of A-to-Z terms that one should know if they are into serious javascript programming.

### **A**sync/**Await**

[Async][async] and [Await][await] are new features introduced in the language to make asynchronous code block look synchronous and more importantly make it more readable.

### **B**rendan Eich

[Brendan Eich][brendaneich] is the creator of JavaScript. He created the language in a matter of 10 days when working for Netscape Navigator. Due credit to be given to him for creating this language.

### **C**losure/**C**allbacks

[Closures][closures] is one key aspect of the language which makes is support functional programming concepts and also very centric to its event driven approach to running code.

[Callbacks][callbacks] are functions passed as parameters to other functions more often to support asynchronous code execution.

### **D**ynamically Typed

JavaScript is a [dynamically][dynamic-typing] typed language - an advantage as well as a disadvantage

### **E**CMAScript/**E**ventLoop

JavaScript's official name is [ECMAScript][ecmascript].

If you have to understand about [eventloop][event-loop], then you have to watch this [talk][philip-roberts].

### **F**unctional

JavaScript supports functional style of programming. If you want to learn more about this, you could read [here][functional-light].

### **G**enerators

[Generators][generators] are functions that could save context across re-entrances.

### **H**

--To be Added--

### **I**IFE

[IIFE][iife] is a short form of immediately invoked function expression. These are functions which get invoked along with their definition.

### **J**SON

[JSON][json] is the defacto standard for message format used in communications over the Web.

### **K**

### **L**

### **M**DN

[MDN][mdn] is the official source of truth for all your JavaScript reference.

### **N**ode

[NodeJS][node] is a JavaScript runtime which is built on top of Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine.

### **O**bjects

[Objects][objects] are the fundamental building blocks of any JavaScript program. It gives us the equivalence of Classes/Objects present in a Object Oriented Language like Java, C++.

### **P**rototypal Inheritance

JavaScript supports inheritance through [prototype chaining][prototype-chain].

### **Q**

--To be Added--

### **R**

--To be Added--

### **S**ervice Worker

[Service Workers][service-worker] can be thought of as proxies to your backend and enables great user experiences like offline capability, optimistic loading of resources etc.

### **T**

--To be Added--

### **U**

--To be Added--

### **V**

--To be Added--

### **W**eb Assembly/**W**eb Worker

[Web Assembly][web-assembly] is mechanism or a provision by which browsers can execute assembly/compiled code. This opens up a whole lot of new things that could possible in a web app escpecially performance intrinsic ones like gaming, image processing etc all happening inside a browser.

[Web Workers][web-worker] are means to achieve multi threading in browsers where we could do execute JS in parallel without affecting the main thread.

### **X**

### **Y**

### **Z**

Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for the **To Be Added** letters and also any terms that I have missed out...
