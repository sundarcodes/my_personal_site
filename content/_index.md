A software engineer having more than a decade and half years of experience in writing and developing network, system and web application softwares. Started my career as a C,C++ programmer, helped companies build network management softwares and later went on to build stock exchange management systems software. Moved to web and mobile app development over the few years and has absolutely enjoyed the transition since then. Have dabbled with machine learning in last few years. I love to mentor and build strong tech teams. To summarise, a polyglot programmer who loves to build teams and products.

Over the years, I got to realize that writing code is an art which is not just about solving a problem but more importantly to write in such a way people are able to read, understand, learn, appreciate and maintain it. Currently, building products in AI/RPA domain.

Apart from coding, I love teaching and reading. I was a mentor in a programming bootcamp based out of India and enjoyed every bit of it. If you donâ€™t find me coding or reading, then you would either find me playing with my kids or helping out my wife setting up our home. But I have to admit that playing with my kids is the most fun of them all :)
