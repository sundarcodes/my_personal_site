This was a workshop cum training program for faculties of engineering colleges across India. I had the chance to talk about the evolution of modern day architecture - Cloud Native, Microservices.
In this talk, I covered the tech journey of how amazon grew from a online book buying platform to a massive ecommerce market place. In the due process, covered the following topics

- Started as a 2 tier architecture
- Grew into a monolith with multi tier architecture
- Evolved into a Service Oriented architecture
- Birth of AWS - Amazon web services
- NoSQL movement
- Microservices all the way
- Serverless/Lambda
