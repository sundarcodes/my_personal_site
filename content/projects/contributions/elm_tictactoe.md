[BuiltWithElm](https://builtwithelm.co/?q=TIC%20T) is a place where Elm enthusiasts can post any of their cool projects built on Elm. I wanted to try a functional programming language and got impressed with Elm. I came know about Elm after reading how it has influenced the Flux and Redux architecture that are being used for State management in the front end. Elm is inspired by haskell and it is something that I want to make use for building a production grade web app.
