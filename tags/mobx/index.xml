      <description>In part-1 of this series, we got to know what state is and the need to have a state management solution especially in the case of a large web app. In this post, we will be seeing how we can solve our shared state problem using a solution called Mobx.
Mobx is a non-opionated state management technique which again uses concepts of observable that we had seen in part-3. You could say mobx is a wrapper built on top of observables and does lot of magic under the hood.</description>

      <description>This is part-1 of the blog series where I would be trying to explain state management in Angular 2+ app using different strategies along with their pros and cons.
In this part, I will try to demystify the term state, how to identify state and why do we need to manage state. So lets get started&amp;hellip;
How do you define state or what is state of an app ? I have seen junior developers who just have Angular(1 &amp;amp; 2+) background struggle to answer this question as they haven&amp;rsquo;t encountered the term state while building apps.</description>
