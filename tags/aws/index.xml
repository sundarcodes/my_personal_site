      <description>This was a workshop cum training program for faculties of engineering colleges across India. I had the chance to talk about the evolution of modern day architecture - Cloud Native, Microservices. In this talk, I covered the tech journey of how amazon grew from a online book buying platform to a massive ecommerce market place. In the due process, covered the following topics
 Started as a 2 tier architecture Grew into a monolith with multi tier architecture Evolved into a Service Oriented architecture Birth of AWS - Amazon web services NoSQL movement Microservices all the way Serverless/Lambda  </description>

      <description>This project was about creating an OCR solution to understand and read hand written information from application forms. This involved using deep learning algorithms for image classification, object detection and character recognition. The entire ML life cycle of gathering data, annotating the data, training the models on different deep learning algorithms was followed and finally the solution was deployed on Cloud.</description>
