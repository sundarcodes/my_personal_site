      <description>This project was about creating an OCR solution to understand and read hand written information from application forms. This involved using deep learning algorithms for image classification, object detection and character recognition. The entire ML life cycle of gathering data, annotating the data, training the models on different deep learning algorithms was followed and finally the solution was deployed on Cloud.</description>
